This Application is a single page application of a fake bank.

The purpose of developing this was to introduce myself to in depth TailwindCSS concepts such as dynamically added properties pulled from a styles.js file containing multiple self-made classes via template literals inside my JSX and configuring my own classes and properties inside tailwind.config.cjs file.

<!-- Ex: <div className={`bg-primary ${styles.flexStart}`></div> -->

Also introduce to new concepts that cleans up code AND allows non-coders to change the look and content of a webpage by simply changing properties of a single file with an array of objects.

EX: The Navbar renders the navlinks by mapping through an array on an index.js file.
SEE constants folder.

This project also gets very indepth with tailwind properties to develop a very concise UI from a Figma file.
